All `.graphml` Files were created (and can be viewed) using the ![https://www.yworks.com/yed-live/](yEd-Live tool).

## Exercise 1 - Company (`company.graphml`)

A company is splitted into multiple departments. Employees are belonging to a single department. Besides that an employee can work on multiple projects.

## Exercise 2 - Flight Booking (`flight-booking.graphml`)

An airline is storing the bookings of their passangers. In this exercise you need to model a cutout of the system:

An airplane has a specific type (e.g. "A310"), an ID (e.g. "IF-AGHT"), a construction year and a number of seats.
Airplanes fly specifc routes. Every route has a flightnumber (e.g. "IF-353"). The flightnumber describes the connection including departure, flightdate, flightduration, distance aswell as a departure- and arrivalairport.
Passengers have a name and a firstname aswell as a passengernumber. They can book flights.
