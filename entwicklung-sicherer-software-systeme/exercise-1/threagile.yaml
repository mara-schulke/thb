business_criticality: mission-critical

business_overview:
  description: >
    Google Meet is a video-communication service developed by Google. It is one
    of the key components of Google Workspace that allows high-quality video
    meetings secured with various layers of security to ensure business
    continuity and data protection.

technical_overview:
  description: >
    Google Meet operates on a complex infrastructure designed to handle massive
    simultaneous connections, integrating seamlessly with other Google services
    like Calendar and Gmail to provide a comprehensive communication platform.

questions:
  How are video streams encrypted?: >
    Video streams are encrypted using TLS and SRTP protocols to ensure that all
    communication is secured.

abuse_cases:
  Zoombombing: >
    As an attacker, I want to gain unauthorized access to private meetings to
    disrupt ongoing sessions or eavesdrop on confidential discussions.
  Credential Stuffing: >
    As an attacker, I want to use breached or weak credentials to gain
    unauthorized access to user accounts and impersonate legitimate users.

security_requirements:
  Encryption of Video Streams: Video streams must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols.
  Strong Authentication: Multi-factor authentication must be enforced to prevent unauthorized access.
