\section{Theoretical Foundations}

This section serves as an introduction to the theoretical concepts utilized in this thesis. It is meant to establish a
baseline of understanding for the design, implementation and evaluation phases. It briefly covers relational database theory
(incl. SQL), machine learning fundamentals and their subsequent application for large language models.

% TODO: Improve integration between theoretical sections
% - Add cross-references between related concepts
% - Show how machine learning enables LLMs
% - Connect graph theory to database schema representation
% - Link NLP techniques to practical system components

% TODO: Add forward connections to design section throughout theory
% - Reference specific design functions (σ, φ, π, ρ, ν) where relevant
% - Connect theoretical concepts to algorithmic implementations
% - Bridge gap between formal foundations and practical system design
