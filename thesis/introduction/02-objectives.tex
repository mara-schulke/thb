\subsection{Objectives of the Thesis}\label{section:introduction:objectives}

This thesis addresses the challenges of database accessibility by:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Developing a portable and offline-only NL2SQL system that can
        translate natural language queries into semantically accurate SQL
        queries using Large Language Models.
    \item Evaluating the effectiveness and feasibility of different models
        and machine learning techniques to improve the performance of
        the system.
    \item Benchmarking the performance of the implementation against common
        NL2SQL benchmarks.
    \item Identifying use cases for real world scenarios that could
        deliver improvements to users.
    \item Analyzing the shortcomings and limitations of the system and
        propose solutions to overcome them.
\end{enumerate}
