\subsection{Objectives of the Thesis}

This thesis aims to address the aforementioned challanges when it comes to database accessibility.
The following objectives are the core research area of this thesis:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a portable and offline-only NL2SQL system that can translate
        natural language queries into semantically accurate SQL queries using
        Large Language Models.
    \item Evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of different Models aswell
        as machine learning techniques in order to improve the performance of the system.
    \item Benchmark the performance of the implementation against common NL2SQL benchmarks.
    \item Idenitfy potential use cases for real world scenarios that could deliver a noticable improvements to users.
    \item Analyze the short commings and limitations of the developed system and propose potential solutions to overcome them.
\end{enumerate}
