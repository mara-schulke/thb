\subsection{Objectives of the Thesis}\label{section:introduction:objectives}

This thesis aims to address the challenges
of database accessibility. The following objectives are the core research area:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a portable and offline-only NL2SQL system that can translate
        natural language queries into semantically accurate SQL queries using
        Large Language Models.
    \item Evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of different models
        and machine learning techniques to improve the performance of
        the system.
    \item Benchmark the performance of the implementation against common NL2SQL
        benchmarks.
    \item Identify use cases for real world scenarios that could
        deliver improvements to users.
    \item Analyze the shortcomings and limitations of the system and
        propose solutions to overcome them.
\end{enumerate}
