\subsection{Research Questions}\label{section:introduction:research-questions}

This thesis investigates the applicability and competitiveness of local and
open-source NL2SQL systems.

\subsubsection*{RQ1 — To what extent can open-source LLMs achieve competitive NL2SQL performance through pipeline composition and optimization?}

State-of-the-art systems combine multiple techniques like in-context learning,
self-correction and candidate selection. This research
question investigates whether the gap between proprietary systems and
open-source models like \textsc{OmniSQL} can be closed by combining the models
with additional NL2SQL techniques. Specifically:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Can pipeline composition improve the performance of fine-tuned models?
    \item How does the performance of open-source NL2SQL systems compare to
        closed-source model baselines on standard benchmarks?
    \item What accuracy ceiling can be achieved within consumer hardware constraints?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{RQ2 — How do NL2SQL pipeline components interact, and which configurations optimize the accuracy-latency tradeoff?}

To resolve the dependency on proprietary systems for NL2SQL, a cost-effective
local deployment must be achieved. An offline NL2SQL system must utilize
compute efficiently as combining all available techniques may not be optimal
for performance characteristics, as components redundancies, or components with
unfavorable cost-benefit ratios harm accuracy-latency tradeoff. This research
question investigates the interactions of pipeline components and which
configurations are favorable:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Do independent components of NL2SQL systems provide independent
        benefits or do they interact synergistically?
    \item Which components contribute most to accuracy improvement, and which add
        latency without substantial benefit?
    \item How should pipelines be configured for different deployment scenarios (exploratory
        analysis vs production queries, simple vs complex databases)?
    \item What is the optimal tradeoff between accuracy and latency by use case?
\end{itemize}
