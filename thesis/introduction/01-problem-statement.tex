\subsection{Problem Statement and Motivation}\label{section:introduction:problem}

Most Database Management Systems (DBMS) require specialized knowledge of the
Structured Query Language (SQL) in order for users to query data. This
represents a usability barrier for domain experts, data analysts and
researchers. Recently Large Language Models (LLMs) have made natural language
interfaces to databases (NLIDBs) substantially more feasible due to their
language understanding and reasoning capabilities.

State-of-the-art NL2SQL systems unfortunately largely depend on proprietary
models to achieve their accuracy. These models require transmitting database
schemas and queries to external services, conflicting with data sovereignty
requirements and security policies in regulated sectors such as healthcare,
finance, and government technology, thus creating a gap between theoretical
research performance and deployable systems. This thesis explores approaches to
overcome these barriers, presenting a sovergein and open-source NL2SQL
system which allows users in restricted sectors to interact with their data
intuitively.
