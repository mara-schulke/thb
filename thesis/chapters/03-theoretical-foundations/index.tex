\section{Theoretical Foundations}

This section serves as an introduction to the theoretical concepts utilized in this thesis. It is meant to establish a
baseline of understanding for the design, implementation and evaluation phases. It briefly covers relational database theory
(incl. SQL), machine learning fundamentals and their subsequent application for large language models.
